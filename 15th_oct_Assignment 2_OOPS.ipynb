    "# Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Constructor: The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created \n",
    "# from a class. In Python, the constructor method is named __init__.\n",
    "# Regular Method: Regular methods are used to define the behavior or actions that objects created from the class can \n",
    "# perform. They operate on the attributes of the object and can be called after the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Constructor: The constructor is automatically invoked when an object is created from a class. It is called once during \n",

    "# multiple times throughout the object's lifecycle.\n",

    "# Name:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Constructor: In Python, the constructor method is named __init__. It is a special method that is automatically called \n",
    "# during object creation.\n",
    "# Regular Method: Regular methods have user-defined names and are called explicitly by the user.\n",

    "# Return Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Constructor: The __init__ constructor does not explicitly return a value. It is primarily used for initializing the \n",
    "# object's attributes.\n",
    "# Regular Method: Regular methods can have a return statement, and they may return a value or perform some action without\n",
    "# returning anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage of self:\n",

    "# Constructor: The constructor takes self as the first parameter, representing the instance of the class being created. \n",

    "# Method Overloading in Python Inheritance:\n",
    "# Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with different\n",
    "# parameters. Python, unlike some other programming languages, does not support traditional method overloading based \n",
    "# on the number or types of parameters. However, Python achieves method overloading through a feature \n",
    "# called \"default arguments\" and using variable-length argument lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=None, c=None):\n",
    "        if b is not None and c is not None:\n",
    "            return a + b + c\n",

    "print(math_ops.add(2, 3, 4))    # Output: 9\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the add method is overloaded with different sets of parameters. If you call it with one argument,\n",
    "# it returns that argument; if you call it with two, it adds them; and if you call it with three, it adds all three.\n",

    "# Method Overriding in Python Inheritance:\n",

    "# parameters as the one in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",

    "# parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method Overloading: Achieved through default arguments and variable-length argument lists.\n",

    "# Data Hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object from the outside world. The attributes of a class are typically \n",

    "\n",
    "# Access to the internal attributes and methods is controlled by using access specifiers like public, private, and \n",

    "\n",
    "# Bundling of Data and Methods:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation enables information hiding, which means that the internal implementation details of a class are hidden \n",

    "# Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Improved Code Organization:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation provides a clear structure for organizing code. Class interfaces (public methods) act as a contract for how\n",

    "# Encapsulation allows for changes to the internal implementation of a class without affecting the external code that uses\n",

    "# Controlled Access:\n",

    "# Polymorphism and method overloading are related concepts in Python, but they differ in their implementation and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism:\n",
    "# Definition: Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be \n",
    "# treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to be used for different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Type: There are two main types of polymorphism in Python: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) \n",
    "# and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",

    "    def make_sound(self):\n",

    "# Usage\n",
    "def animal_sound(animal):\n",

    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "animal_sound(dog)  # Outputs: Woof!\n",
    "animal_sound(cat)  # Outputs: Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method Overloading:\n",
    "# Definition: Method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name in a class but with different parameters. In some programming languages, the correct method is selected at compile time based on the number and types of arguments provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Type: Typically associated with compile-time polymorphism, but in Python, it's achieved using default parameter values or\n",
    "# variable-length argument lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b, c=None):\n",
    "        if c is not None:\n",
    "            return a + b + c\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "math_obj = MathOperations()\n",
    "result1 = math_obj.add(2, 3)        # Calls the first add method\n",
    "result2 = math_obj.add(2, 3, 4)     # Calls the second add method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the given example, Python doesn't natively support traditional method overloading based on the number\n",
    "# or types of parameters. Instead, you achieve a similar effect by using default parameter values or variable-length\n",
    "# argument lists. The appropriate method is determined at runtime based on the actual arguments passed."

    "# 16. What is dynamic polymorphism, and how is it achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic polymorphism, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a concept in object-oriented programming \n",
    "# where the appropriate method or operation is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This allows\n",
    "# different objects to respond to the same method or operation in a way that is specific to their individual types. \n",
    "# Dynamic polymorphism is a key feature of object-oriented languages, promoting flexibility and extensibility in code \n",
    "# design.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, dynamic polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and the use of inheritance. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance:\n",
    "# Dynamic polymorphism relies on the concept of inheritance, where a subclass (derived class) inherits attributes and \n",
    "# behaviors from a superclass (base class). The subclass can override or extend methods inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method Overriding:\n",
    "# When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, it is said \n",
    "# to override that method. The overridden method in the subclass has the same name and signature as the method in the \n",
    "# superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "# super() Function:\n",
    "# The super() function is often used in Python to call a method from the superclass within the overridden method in the \n",
    "# subclass. This allows the subclass to reuse and extend the behavior of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 19. How can you achieve flexibility in composed objects by allowing them to be replaced or modified dynamically at runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Achieving flexibility in composed objects, allowing them to be replaced or modified dynamically at runtime, can be \n",
    "# accomplished through various design patterns and principles. Here are some approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Strategy Pattern:\n",
    "# Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable. This allows the client to \n",
    "# choose the appropriate algorithm dynamically.\n",
    "# In the context of composed objects, different strategies can represent different behaviors or components that can be \n",
    "# switched at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dependency Injection:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instead of creating and managing dependencies within a class, inject dependencies from the outside. This allows the\n",
    "# components to be replaced or modified without modifying the class.\n",
    "# In Python, dependency injection can be achieved through constructor injection or method injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Factory Pattern:\n",
    "# Use a factory to create instances of components or objects. The factory can be configured to produce different \n",
    "# types of objects based on runtime conditions.\n",
    "# This allows for the dynamic creation of objects without tightly coupling the client to concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract Factory Pattern:\n",
    "# Define an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n",
    "# Clients can use the abstract factory to create sets of objects that work together, and the specific factory implementation\n",
    "# can be swapped at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decorator Pattern:\n",
    "# Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing\n",
    "# for extending functionality.\n",
    "# In the context of composed objects, decorators can be dynamically added or removed to modify the behavior of the composed \n",
    "# object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configuration or Settings:\n",
    "# Store configuration or settings externally and load them dynamically at runtime. This allows for easy modification of \n",
    "# object behavior without code changes.\n",
    "# Configuration can include specifying which components or strategies to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Binding and Polymorphism:\n",
    "# Leverage dynamic binding and polymorphism in languages like Python. Design interfaces or abstract classes, and allow different implementations to be used interchangeably.\n",
    "# Objects can be dynamically assigned to variables or passed as parameters based on runtime conditions.\n",
    "\n"
